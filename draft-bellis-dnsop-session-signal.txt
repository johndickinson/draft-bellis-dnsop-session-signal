Abstract

   The Extension Mechanisms for DNS (EDNS(0)) [RFC6891] is explicitly
   defined to only have "per-message" semantics.  This document defines
   a new Session Signaling OpCode used to carry persistent "per-session"
   type-length-values (TLVs), and defines an initial set of TLVs used to
   manage session timeouts and termination.

1.  Introduction

   The Extension Mechanisms for DNS (EDNS(0)) [RFC6891] is explicitly
   defined to only have "per-message" semantics.  This document defines
   a new Session Signaling OpCode used to carry persistent "per-session"
   type-length-values (TLVs), and defines an initial set of TLVs used to
   manage session timeouts and termination.

   A further issue with EDNS(0) is that there is no standard mechanism
   for a client to be able to tell whether a server has processed or
   otherwise acted upon the individual options contained with an OPT RR.
   The Session Signaling Opcode therefore requires an explicit response
   to each request message.

   It should be noted that the message format (see Section 3.1) does not
   conform to the standard DNS packet format.

Internet-Draft            DNS Session Signaling                July 2016


2.  Terminology

   The terms "initiator" and "responder" correspond respectively to the
   initial sender and subsequent receiver of a Session Signaling TLV,
   regardless of which was the "client" and "server" in the usual DNS
   sense.  The term "sender" may apply to either an initiator or
   responder.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Protocol Details

   Session Signaling messages MUST only be carried in protocols and in
   environments that can guarantee that the same two endpoints are in
   communication for the entire lifetime of the session.

   Session Signaling messages relate only to the specific session in
   which they are being carried.  Where a middle box (e.g. a DNS proxy,
   forwarder, or session multiplexer) is in the path the message MUST
   NOT be blindly forwarded in either direction by that middle box.
   This does not preclude the use of these messages in the presence of a
   NAT box that rewrites Layer 3 or Layer 4 headers but otherwise
   maintains the effect of a single session.

3.1.  Message Format

   A message containing a Session Signaling Opcode does not conform to
   the usual DNS message format.  The 4 octet header format from
   [RFC1035] is however preserved, since that includes the message ID
   and OpCode and RCODE fields, and the QR bit that differentiates
   requests from responses.

   Each message MUST contain only a single TLV.

                                                1   1   1   1   1   1

   << RB: put field descriptions in here? >>

3.2.  Message Handling

   Both clients and servers may unilaterally send Session Signaling
   messages at any point in the lifetime of a session and are therefore
   considered to be the initiator with respect to that message.  The
   initiator MUST set the value of the QR bit in the DNS header to zero
   (0), and the responder MUST set it to one (1).

   Every Session Signaling request message MUST elicit a response (which
   MUST have the same ID in the DNS message header as in the request).

   In order to preserve the correct sequence of state, Session Signaling
   requests MUST NOT be processed out of order.

   << RB: should the presence of a SS message create a "sequencing
   point", such that all pending responses must be answered? >>

   The RCODE value in a response uses a subset of the standard (non-
   extended) RCODE values from the IANA DNS RCODEs registry, interpreted
   as follows:

     +------+----------+---------------------------------+-----------+
     | Code | Mnemonic | Description                     | Reference |
     +------+----------+---------------------------------+-----------+
     |    0 | NOERROR  | TLV processed successfully      | RFC-TBD1  |
     |      |          |                                 |           |
     |    4 | NOTIMP   | Session Signaling not supported | RFC-TBD1  |
     |      |          |                                 |           |
     |    5 | REFUSED  | TLV declined for policy reasons | RFC-TBD1  |
     +------+----------+---------------------------------+-----------+

   << RB: any others? >>

   SESSION-TYPE:  A 16 bit field in network order giving the type of the
      current Session Signaling TLV per the IANA DNS Session Signaling
      Type Codes Registry.

   SESSION-LENGTH:  A 16 bit field in network order giving the size in
      octets of SESSION-DATA.

   SESSION-DATA:  Type-code specific.

4.  Mandatory TLVs

4.1.  Session Management Support TLVs

4.1.1.  "Not Implemented"

   Since the "NOTIMP" RCODE is required to indicate lack of support for
   the Session Signaling OpCode itself, the "Not Implemented" TLV (0)
   MUST be returned in response to a TLV that is not implemented by the
   responder.

   This TLV has no SESSION-DATA.

4.2.  Session Management TLVs

4.2.1.  Terminate

   The Terminate TLV (1) MAY be sent by a server to request that the
   client terminate the session.  It MUST NOT be initiated by a client.

   The client SHOULD terminate the session as soon as possible, but MAY
   wait for any inflight queries to be answered.  It MUST NOT initiate
   any new requests over the existing session.

   The SESSION-DATA is as follows:

                                                1   1   1   1   1   1
        0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   0   1   2   3   4   5
      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
      |                        RECONNECT DELAY                        |
      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   RECONNECT DELAY:  a time value, specified as a 16 bit word in network
      order in units of 100 milliseconds, within which the client MUST
      NOT establish a new session to the current server.

   The RECOMMENDED value is 10 seconds.  << RB: text required here about
   default values for load balancers, etc >>

4.2.2.  Idle Timeout

   The Idle Timeout TLV (2) has similar semantics to the EDNS TCP
   Keepalive Option [RFC7828].  It is used by a server to tell the
   client how long it may leave the current session idle for.

   The SESSION-DATA is as follows:

                                                1   1   1   1   1   1
        0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   0   1   2   3   4   5
      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
      |                         IDLE TIMEOUT                          |
      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   IDLE TIMEOUT:  the idle timeout for the current session, specified as
      a 16 bit word in network order in units of 100 milliseconds.

   The client SHOULD terminate the current session if it remains idle
   for longer than the specified timeout (and MAY of course terminate
   the session earlier).  The server MAY unilaterally terminate the
   connection at any time, but SHOULD allow the client to keep the
   connection open if further messages are received before the idle
   timeout expires.

   A client / server pair that supports Session Signaling MUST NOT use
   the EDNS TCP KeepAlive option within any message once Session
   Signaling support has been negotiated.

5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  DNS Session Signaling OpCode Registration

   IANA are directed to assign the value TBD for the Session Signaling
   OpCode in the DNS OpCodes Registry.

5.2.  DNS Session Signaling Type Codes Registry

   IANA are directed to create the DNS Session Signaling Type Codes
   Registry, with initial values as follows:
