<p id="rfc.section.1.p.1">The use of transports for DNS other than UDP is being increasingly specified, for example, DNS over TCP <a href="#RFC1035" class="xref">[RFC1035]</a><a href="#RFC7766" class="xref">[RFC7766]</a> and DNS over TLS <a href="#RFC7858" class="xref">[RFC7858]</a>.  Such transports can offer persistent, long-lived sessions and therefore when using them for transporting DNS messages it is of benefit to have a mechanism that can establish parameters associated with those sessions, such as timeouts.  In such situations it is also advantageous to support server initiated messages.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.2">The existing EDNS(0) Extension Mechanism for DNS <a href="#RFC6891" class="xref">[RFC6891]</a> is explicitly defined to only have &#8220;per-message&#8221; semantics. Whilst EDNS(0) has been used to signal at least one session related parameter (the EDNS(0) TCP Keepalive option <a href="#RFC7828" class="xref">[RFC7828]</a>) the result is less than optimal due to the restrictions imposed by the EDNS(0) semantics and the lack of server-initiated signalling.  For example, a server cannot arbitrarily instruct a client to close a connection because the server can only send EDNS(0) options in responses to queries that contained EDNS(0) options.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.3">This document defines a new DNS Stateful Operation OPCODE used to carry operations within persistent stateful connections, expressed using type-length-value (TLV) syntax, and defines an initial set of TLVs including ones used to manage session timeouts and termination.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.4">This new format has distinct advantages over an RR based format because it is more explicit and more compact. Each TLV definition is specific to the use case, and as a result contains no redundant or overloaded fields.  Importantly, it completely avoids conflating DNS Stateful Operations in anyway with normal DNS operations or with existing EDNS(0) based functionality. A goal of this approach is to avoid the operational issues that have befallen EDNS(0), particularly relating to middle-box behaviour.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.5">With EDNS(0), multiple options may be packed into a single OPT pseudo-RR, and there is no generalized mechanism for a client to be able to tell whether a server has processed or otherwise acted upon each individual option within the combined OPT RR.  The specifications for each individual option need to define how each different option is to be acknowledged, if necessary.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.6">With DNS Stateful Operations, in contrast, there is no compelling motivation to pack multiple operations into a single message for efficiency reasons.  Each Stateful operation is communicated in its own separate DNS message, and the transport protocol can take care of packing separate DNS messages into a single IP packet if appropriate.  For example, TCP can pack multiple small DNS messages into a single TCP segment.  The RCODE in each response message indicates the success or failure of the operation in question.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.7">It should be noted that the message format for DNS Stateful Operations (see <a href="#format" class="xref">Section 4.2</a>) differs from the traditional DNS packet format used for standard queries and responses.  The standard twelve-octet header is used, but the four count fields (QDCOUNT, ANCOUNT, NSCOUNT, ARCOUNT) are set to zero and their corresponding sections are not present.  The actual data pertaining to DNS Stateful Operations is appended to the end of the DNS message header.  When displayed using today&#8217;s packet analyzer tools that have not been updated to recognize the DNS Stateful Operations format, this will result in the Stateful Operations data being displayed as unknown additional data after the end of the DNS message. It is likely that future updates to these tools will add the ability to recognize, decode, and display the Stateful Operations data.</p>

<li>Either end of the connection may initiate messages to the other.</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.6">A &#8220;DSO session&#8221; is established between two endpoints that acknowledge persistent DNS state via the exchange of DSO messages over the connection. This is distinct from, for example a DNS-over-TCP session as described in RC7766.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.2.p.11">The term &#8220;sender&#8221; may apply to either an initiator (when sending a DNS Stateful Operation request message) or a responder (when sending a DNS Stateful Operation response message).</p>

</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.16">The timeouts associated with these timers are called the inactivity timeout and the keepalive interval respectively.  The term &#8220;Session Timeouts&#8221; is used to refer to this pair of timeout values.</p>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.1">There are several use cases for DNS Stateful operations that can be described here.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.2">Firstly, establishing session parameters such as server defined timeouts is of great use in the general management of persistent connections. For example, using DSO sessions for stub to recursive DNS-over-TLS <a href="#RFC7858" class="xref">[RFC7858]</a> is more flexible for both the client and the server than attempting to manage sessions using just the EDNS(0) TCP Keepalive option <a href="#RFC7828" class="xref">[RFC7828]</a>. The simple set of TLVs defined in this document is sufficient to greatly enhance connection management for this use case.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.3">Secondly, DNS-SD has evolved into a naturally session based mechanism where, for example, long-lived subscriptions lend themselves to &#8216;push&#8217; mechanisms as opposed to polling. Long-lived stateful connections and server initiated messages align with this use case as described in <a href="#I-D.ietf-dnssd-push" class="xref">[I-D.ietf-dnssd-push]</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.4">A general use case is that DNS traffic is often bursty but session establishment can be expensive. One challenge with long-lived connections is to maintain sufficient traffic to maintain NAT and firewall state. To mitigate this issue this document introduces a new concept for the DNS, that is DSO &#8220;Keepalive traffic&#8221;. This traffic carries no DNS data and is not considered &#8216;activity&#8217; in the classic DNS sense but serves to reset a keepalive timer in order to avoid re-cycling a DSO session.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.5">There are a myriad of other potential use cases for DSO given the versatility and extensibility of this specification.</p>
<p><a href="#details" class="xref">Section 4</a> of this document first describes the protocol details of DNS Stateful Operations including definitions of three TLVs for session management and encryption padding. <a href="#lifecycle" class="xref">Section 8</a> then presents a detailed discussion of the DSO Session lifecycle including an in-depth discussion of keepalive traffic and session termination.</p>

<h1 id="rfc.section.4.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.4.1">4.1.</a> <a href="#establishment" id="establishment">DSO Session Establishment</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.1">DSO messages MUST only be carried in protocols and in environments where a session may be established according to the definition above.  Standard DNS over TCP <a href="#RFC1035" class="xref">[RFC1035]</a><a href="#RFC7766" class="xref">[RFC7766]</a>, and DNS over TLS <a href="#RFC7858" class="xref">[RFC7858]</a> are suitable protocols.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.2">DNS over plain UDP <a href="#RFC0768" class="xref">[RFC0768]</a> is not appropriate since it fails on the requirement for in-order message delivery, and, in the presence of NAT gateways and firewalls with short UDP timeouts, it fails to provide a persistent bi-directional communication channel unless an excessive amount of keepalive traffic is used.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.3">DSO messages relate only to the specific &#8220;DSO session&#8221; in which they are being carried. A &#8220;DSO session&#8221; is established over a connection when either side of the connection sends the first DSO TLV and it is acknowledged by the other side. The DSO message format <a href="#dsodata" class="xref">Section 4.2.2</a> includes an option to specify that a DSO request does not require a response acknowledgement. Session establishment can only be performed using a DSO message that requires a response acknowledgement.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.4">While this specification defines an initial set of three TLVs, additional TLVs may be defined in additional specifications. All three of the TLVs defined here are mandatory to implement.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.5">A client MAY attempt to initiate DSO messages at any time on a connection; receiving a NOTIMP response in reply indicates that the server does not implement DSO, and the client SHOULD NOT issue further DSO messages on that connection.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.6">A server SHOULD NOT initiate DSO messages until a client-initiated DSO message is received first, unless in an environment where it is known in advance by other means that the client supports DSO.  This requirement is to ensure that the clients that do not support DSO do not receive unsolicited inbound DSO messages that they would not know how to handle.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.7">On a session between a client and server that support DSO, once the client has sent at least one DSO message (or it is known in advance by other means that the client supports DSO) either end may unilaterally send DSO messages at any time, and therefore either client or server may be the initiator of a message.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.8">From this point on it is considered that a &#8220;DSO session&#8221; is in progress. Clients and servers should behave as described in this specification with regard to inactivity timeouts and connection close, not as prescribed in <a href="#RFC7766" class="xref">[RFC7766]</a>.</p>

<a href="#rfc.section.4.1.1">4.1.1.</a> <a href="#middle-box-considerations" id="middle-box-considerations">Middle-box Considerations</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.1.p.1">Where an application-layer middle box (e.g., a DNS proxy, forwarder, or session multiplexer) is in the path the middle box MUST NOT blindly forward DSO messages in either direction, and MUST treat the inbound and outbound connections as separate sessions.  This does not preclude the use of DSO messages in the presence of an IP-layer middle box such as a NAT that rewrites IP-layer and/or transport-layer headers, but otherwise preserves the effect of a single session between the client and the server.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.1.p.2">To illustrate the above, consider a network where a middle box terminates one or more TCP connections from clients and multiplexes the queries therein over a single TCP connection to an upstream server.  The DSO messages and any associated state are specific to the individual TCP connections.  A DSO-aware middle box MAY in some circumstances be able to retain associated state and pass it between the client and server (or vice versa) but this would be highly TLV-specific.  For example, the middle box may be able to maintain a list of which clients have made Push Notification subscriptions <a href="#I-D.ietf-dnssd-push" class="xref">[I-D.ietf-dnssd-push]</a> and make its own subscription(s) on their behalf, relaying any subsequent notifications to the client (or clients) that have subscribed to that particular notification.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.4.2.p.1">A DSO message begins with the standard twelve-octet DNS message header <a href="#RFC1035" class="xref">[RFC1035]</a> with the OPCODE field set to the DSO OPCODE (tentatively 6).  However, unlike standard DNS messages, the question section, answer section, authority records section and additional records sections are not present.  The corresponding count fields (QDCOUNT, ANCOUNT, NSCOUNT, ARCOUNT) MUST be set to zero on transmission.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.p.2">If a DSO message is received where any of the count fields are not zero, then a FORMERR MUST be returned.</p>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.5.p.1">The Keepalive Operation TLV (DSO-TYPE=1) performs two functions: to reset the keepalive timer for the DSO session and to establish the values for the Session Timeouts.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.p.2">The Keepalive Operation TLV resets only the keepalive timer, not the inactivity timer. The reason for this is that periodic Keepalive Operation TLVs are sent for the sole purpose of keeping a DSO session alive because that DSO session has current or recent activity that warrants keeping the DSO session alive.  If sending keepalive traffic itself were to reset the inactivity timer, then that would create a circular livelock where keepalive traffic would be sent indefinitely to keep a DSO session alive, where the only activity on that DSO session would be keepalive traffic keeping the DSO session alive so that further keepalive traffic can be sent.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.p.3">Sending keepalive traffic is considered a maintenance activity that is performed in service of other client activities.  Sending keepalive traffic itself is not considered a client activity.  For a DSO session to be considered active, it must be carrying something more than just keepalive traffic.  This is why merely sending a Keepalive Operation TLV does not reset the inactivity timer.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.p.4">When sent by a client, the Keepalive Operation TLV resets a DSO session&#8217;s keepalive timer, and at the same time requests what the Session Timeout values should be from this point forward in the DSO session.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.p.5">An acknowledgement is always required for a Keepalive Operation TLV and the TLV Acknowledgement bit MUST be set in the request when originated by either the client or the server.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.p.6">Once a DSO session is in progress (see <a href="#details" class="xref">Section 4</a>) the Keepalive TLV also MAY be initiated by a server.  When sent by a server, it resets a DSO session&#8217;s keepalive timer, and unilaterally informs the client of the new Session Timeout values to use from this point forward in this DSO session.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.p.7">It is not required that the Keepalive TLV be used in every DSO session.  While many DNS Stateful operations will be used in conjunction with a long-lived session state, not all DNS Stateful operations require long-lived session state, and in some cases the default 15-second value for both the inactivity timeout and keepalive interval may be perfectly appropriate. However, it can be noted that for clients that implement only the TLVs defined in this document it is the only way for a client to initiate a DSO session.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.5.1.p.2">In the case of the keepalive timer, the handling of the received value is straightforward. The act of receiving the message containing the DSO Keepalive TLV itself resets the keepalive timer and updates the keepalive interval for the DSO session. The new keepalive interval indicates the maximum time that may elapse before another message must be sent or received on this DSO session, if the DSO session is to remain alive.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.1.p.3">In the case of the inactivity timeout, the handling of the received value superficially appears a little more subtle, though the meaning of the inactivity timeout is unchanged &#8211; it still indicates the maximum permissible time allowed without activity on a DSO session.  The act of receiving the message containing the DSO Keepalive TLV does not itself reset the inactivity timer. The time elapsed since the last useful activity on this DSO session is unaffected by exchange of DSO Keepalive messages.  The act of receiving the message containing the DSO Keepalive TLV does update the timeout associated with the running inactivity timer; that becomes the new maximum permissible time without activity on a DSO session.</p>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>If the inactivity timer value is not greater than the new inactivity timeout, then the DSO session may remain open for now. When the inactivity timer value exceeds the new inactivity timeout, the client MUST then close the DSO session, as described above.</li>

<li>If the inactivity timer value is more than twice the new inactivity timeout, then this DSO session is eligible to be forcibly terminated by the server and and the client MUST immediately close this DSO session. However if a server abruptly reduces the inactivity timeout in this way the server SHOULD give the client a grace period of one quarter of the new inactivity timeout, to give the client time to close the connection gracefully before the server resorts to terminating it forcibly.</li>

(In the BSD Sockets API this is achieved by setting the SO_LINGER option to zero before closing the socket.)</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.4.1.p.4">In this context, an operation being active on a DSO session includes a query waiting for a response, an update waiting for a response, or active state, but not a DSO Keepalive message exchange itself.  A DSO Keepalive message exchange resets only the keepalive interval timer, not the inactivity timeout timer.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.4.1.p.5">If the client wishes to keep an inactive DSO session open for longer than the default duration without having to send traffic every 15 seconds, then it uses the DSO Keepalive message to request longer timeout values, as described in <a href="#keepalive" class="xref">Section 5</a>.</p>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.8.4.2.p.1">For the inactivity timeout value, lower values result in more frequent DSO session teardown and re-establishment. Higher values result in lower traffic and CPU load on the server, but a larger memory burden to maintain state for inactive DSO sessions.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.4.2.p.2">A shorter inactivity timeout with a longer keepalive interval signals to the client that it should not speculatively keep inactive DSO sessions open for very long for no reason, but when it does have an active reason to keep a DSO session open, it doesn&#8217;t need to be sending an aggressive level of keepalive traffic.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.4.2.p.3">A longer inactivity timeout with a shorter keepalive interval signals to the client that it may speculatively keep inactive DSO sessions open for a long time, but it should be sending a lot of keepalive traffic on those inactive DSO sessions.  This configuration is expected to be less common.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.4.2.p.4">To avoid excessive traffic the server MUST NOT send a Keepalive message (either a response to a client-initiated request, or a server-initiated message) with an inactivity timeout value less than ten seconds.  If a client receives a Keepalive message specifying an inactivity timeout value less than ten seconds this is an error and the client MUST immediately terminate the connection with a TCP RST (or equivalent for other protocols).</p>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.8.5.p.1">The purpose of the keepalive interval is to manage the generation of sufficient messages to maintain state in middle-boxes (such at NAT gateways or firewalls) and for the client and server to periodically verify that they still have connectivity to each other. This allows them to clean up state when connectivity is lost, and attempt re-connection if appropriate.</p>

To keep the DSO session alive the client MUST send a DSO Keepalive message (see <a href="#keepalive" class="xref">Section 5</a>).  A DSO Keepalive message exchange resets only the keepalive timer, not the inactivity timer.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.5.1.p.2">If a client disconnects from the network abruptly, without cleanly closing its DSO session, leaving long-lived state uncanceled, the server learns of this after failing to receive the required keepalive traffic from that client.  If, at any time during the life of the DSO session, twice the keepalive interval value (i.e., 30 seconds by default) elapses without any DNS messages being sent or received on a DSO session, the server SHOULD consider the client delinquent, and forcibly abort the connection with a TCP RST (or equivalent for other protocols).</p>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.8.5.2.p.1">For the keepalive interval value, lower values result in higher volume keepalive traffic. Higher values of the keepalive interval reduce traffic and CPU load, but have minimal effect on the memory burden at the server, because clients keep a DSO session open for the same length of time (determined by the inactivity timeout) regardless of the level of keepalive traffic required.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.5.2.p.2">It may be appropriate for clients and servers to select different keepalive interval values depending on the nature of the network they are on.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.5.2.p.3">A corporate DNS server that knows it is serving only clients on the internal network, with no intervening NAT gateways or firewalls, can impose a higher keepalive interval, because frequent keepalive traffic is not required.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.5.2.p.4">A public DNS server that is serving primarily residential consumer clients, where it is likely there will be a NAT gateway on the path, may impose a lower keepalive interval, to generate more frequent keepalive traffic.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.5.2.p.5">A smart client may be adaptive to its environment. A client using a private IPv4 address <a href="#RFC1918" class="xref">[RFC1918]</a> to communicate with a DNS server at an address that is not in the same IPv4 private address block, may conclude that there is likely to be a NAT gateway on the path, and accordingly request a lower keepalive interval.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.5.2.p.6">For environments where there is a NAT gateway or firewalls on the path, it is RECOMMENDED that clients request, and servers grant, a keepalive interval of 15 minutes. In other environments it is RECOMMENDED that clients request, and servers grant, a keepalive interval of 60 minutes.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.5.2.p.7">Note that the lower the keepalive interval value, the higher the load on client and server. For example, an keepalive interval value of 100ms would result in a continuous stream of at least ten messages per second, in both directions, to keep the DSO session alive. And, in this extreme example, a single packet loss and retransmission over a long path could introduce a momentary pause in the stream of messages, long enough to cause the server to overzealously abort the connection.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.5.2.p.8">Because of this concern, the server MUST NOT send a Keepalive message (either a response to a client-initiated request, or a server-initiated message) with an keepalive interval value less than ten seconds.  If a client receives an Keepalive message specifying an keepalive interval value less than ten seconds this is an error and the client MUST immediately terminate the connection with a TCP RST (or equivalent for other protocols).</p>

<p id="rfc.section.8.6.p.1">After sending an error response to a client, the server MAY close the DSO session, or may allow the DSO session to remain open. For error conditions that only affect the single operation in question, the server SHOULD return an error response to the client and leave the DSO session open for further operations.  For error conditions that are likely to make all operations unsuccessful in the immediate future, the server SHOULD return an error response to the client and then close the DSO session by sending a Retry Delay request message, as described in <a href="#delay" class="xref">Section 6</a>.</p>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.8.7.p.1">Upon receiving an error response from the server, a client SHOULD NOT automatically close the DSO session. An error relating to one particular operation on a DSO session does not necessarily imply that all other operations on that DSO session have also failed, or that future operations will fail. The client should assume that the server will make its own decision about whether or not to close the DSO session, based on the server&#8217;s determination of whether the error condition pertains to this particular operation, or would also apply to any subsequent operations. If the server does not close the DSO session then the client SHOULD continue to use that DSO session for subsequent operations.</p>

</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.8.8.p.3">a server MUST NOT close a DSO session with a client, except in extraordinary error conditions. Closing the DSO session is the client&#8217;s responsibility, to be done at the client&#8217;s discretion, when it so chooses. A server only closes a DSO session under exceptional circumstances, such as when the server application software or underlying operating system is restarting, the server application terminated unexpectedly (perhaps due to a bug that makes it crash), or the server is undergoing maintenance procedures.  When possible, a server SHOULD send a Retry Delay message informing the client of the reason for the DSO session being closed, and allow the client five seconds to receive it before the server resorts to forcibly aborting the connection.</p>

<a href="#rfc.section.8.9">8.9.</a> <a href="#retry" id="retry">Retry Delay Operation TLV</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.8.9.p.1">There may be rare cases where a server is overloaded and wishes to shed load.  If a server is low on resources it MAY simply terminate a client connection with a TCP RST (or equivalent for other protocols).  However, the likely behavior of the client may be simply to to treat this as a network failure and connect immediately, putting more burden on the server.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.9.p.2">Therefore to avoid this reconnection implosion, a server SHOULD instead choose to shed client load by sending a Retry Delay request message, with an RCODE of SERVFAIL, to inform the client of the overload situation. After sending a Retry Delay request message, the server MUST NOT send any further messages on that DSO session.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.9.p.3">After sending the Retry Delay request the server SHOULD allow the client five seconds to close the connection, and if the client has not closed the connection after five seconds then the server SHOULD abort the connection with a TCP RST (or equivalent for other protocols).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.9.p.4">Upon receipt of a Retry Delay request from the server, the client MUST make note of the reconnect delay for this server, and then immediately close the connection. This is to place the burden of TCP&#8217;s TIME-WAIT state on the client.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.9.p.5">A Retry Delay request message MUST NOT be initiated by a client.  If a server receives a Retry Delay request message this is an error and the server MUST immediately terminate the connection with a TCP RST (or equivalent for other protocols).</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.8.9.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.8.9.1">8.9.1.</a> <a href="#outstanding-operations" id="outstanding-operations">Outstanding Operations</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.8.9.1.p.1">At the moment a server chooses to initiate a Retry Delay request message there may be DNS requests already in flight from client to server on this DSO session, which will arrive at the server after its Retry Delay request message has been sent.  The server MUST silently ignore such incoming requests, and MUST NOT generate any response messages for them. When the Retry Delay request message from the server arrives at the client, the client will determine that any DNS requests it previously sent on this DSO session, that have not yet received a response, now will certainly not be receiving any response. Such requests should be considered failed, and should be retried at a later time, as appropriate.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.9.1.p.2">In the case where some, but not all, of the existing operations on a DSO session have become invalid (perhaps because the server has been reconfigured and is no longer authoritative for some of the names), but the server is terminating all DSO sessions en masse with a REFUSED (5) RCODE, the RECONNECT DELAY MAY be zero, indicating that the clients SHOULD immediately attempt to re-establish operations.  It is likely that some of the attempts will be successful and some will not.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.9.1.p.3">In the case where a server is terminating a large number of DSO sessions at once (e.g., if the system is restarting) and the server doesn&#8217;t want to be inundated with a flood of simultaneous retries, it SHOULD send different RECONNECT delay values to each client.  These adjustments MAY be selected randomly, pseudorandomly, or deterministically (e.g., incrementing the time value by one tenth of a second for each successive client, yielding a post-restart reconnection rate of ten clients per second).</p>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.8.9.2.p.1">After a DSO session is closed by the server, the client SHOULD try to reconnect, to that server, or to another suitable server, if more than one is available.  If reconnecting to the same server, the client MUST respect the indicated delay before attempting to reconnect.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.9.2.p.2">If a particular server does not want a client to reconnect (it is being de-commissioned), it SHOULD set the retry delay to the maximum value (which is approximately 497 days). If the server will only be out of service for a maintenance period, it should use a value closer to the expected maintenance window and not default to a very large delay value or clients may not attempt to reconnect after it resumes service.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.9">
<a href="#rfc.section.9">9.</a> <a href="#sharing" id="sharing">Connection Sharing</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.9.p.1">As in <a href="#RFC7766" class="xref">[RFC7766]</a>, to mitigate the risk of unintentional server overload, DNS clients MUST take care to minimize the number of concurrent TCP connections made to any individual server.  It is RECOMMENDED that for any given client/server interaction there SHOULD be no more than one connection for regular queries, one for zone transfers, and one for each protocol that is being used on top of TCP (for example, if the resolver was using TLS).  However, it is noted that certain primary/ secondary configurations with many busy zones might need to use more than one TCP connection for zone transfers for operational reasons (for example, to support concurrent transfers of multiple zones).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.p.2">A single server may support multiple services, including DNS Updates <a href="#RFC2136" class="xref">[RFC2136]</a>, DNS Push Notifications <a href="#I-D.ietf-dnssd-push" class="xref">[I-D.ietf-dnssd-push]</a>, and other services, for one or more DNS zones.  When a client discovers that the target server for several different operations is the same target hostname and port, the client SHOULD use a single shared DSO session for all those operations.  A client SHOULD NOT open multiple connections to the same target host and port just because the names being operated on are different or happen to fall within different zones.  This is to reduce unnecessary connection load on the DNS server.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.p.3">However, server implementers and operators should be aware that connection sharing may not be possible in all cases.  A single client device may be home to multiple independent client software instances that don&#8217;t coordinate with each other.  Similarly, multiple independent client devices behind the same NAT gateway will also typically appear to the DNS server as different source ports on the same client IP address.  Because of these constraints, a DNS server MUST be prepared to accept multiple connections from different source ports on the same client IP address.</p>
