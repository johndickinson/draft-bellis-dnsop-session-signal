<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">

<t>The use of transports other than UDP for DNS is being increasingly specified,
for example, DNS over TCP <xref target="RFC1035"/><xref target="RFC7766"/> and DNS over TLS <xref target="RFC7858"/>.
Such transports can offer persistent, long-lived sessions and therefore when
using them for transporting DNS messages it is of benefit to have a mechanism
that can establish parameters associated with those sessions, such as timeouts.
In such situations it is also advantageous to support server initiated messages.</t>

<t>The EDNS(0) Extension Mechanism for DNS <xref target="RFC6891"/> is explicitly
defined to only have “per-message” semantics. Whilst EDNS(0) has been used to
signal at least one session related parameter (the EDNS(0) TCP KeepAlive option
<xref target="RFC7828"/>) the result is less than optimal due to the restrictions
imposed by the EDNS(0) semantics and the lack of server initiated signalling.
This document defines a new Session Signaling Opcode used to carry persistent
“per-session” type-length-values (TLVs), and defines an initial set of TLVs used to
manage session timeouts and termination.</t>

<t>With EDNS(0), multiple options may be packed into a single OPT pseudo-RR, and
there is no generalized mechanism for a client to be able to tell
whether a server has processed or otherwise acted upon each individual
option within the combined OPT RR.  The specifications for each
individual option need to define how each different option is to be
acknowledged, if necessary.</t>

<t>With Session Signaling, in contrast, there is no compelling motivation
to pack multiple operations into a single message for efficiency reasons.
Each Session Signaling operation is communicated in its own separate
DNS message, and the transport protocol can take care of packing
separate DNS messages into a single IP packet if appropriate.
For example, TCP can pack multiple small DNS messages into a single TCP segment.
The RCODE in each response message indicates the success or failure of the operation in question.</t>

<t>It should be noted that the message format for Session Signaling
operations (see <xref target="format"/>) differs from the DNS packet format used for
standard queries and responses, in that it has a shorter header (four
octets instead of usual twelve octets).</t>

</section>
<section anchor="terminology" title="Terminology">

<t>The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”,
“SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “NOT RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and
“OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in
“Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels” <xref target="RFC2119"/>.</t>

<t>The term “server” means the software with a listening socket, awaiting
incoming connection requests.</t>

<t>The term “client” means the software which initiates a connection
to the server’s listening socket.</t>

<t>The terms “initiator” and “responder” correspond respectively to the
initial sender and subsequent receiver of a Session Signaling TLV,
regardless of which was the “client” and “server” in the usual DNS sense.</t>

<t>The term “sender” may apply to either an initiator or responder.</t>

<t>The term “session” in the context of this document means the exchange of
DNS messages using an end-to-end transport protocol where:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>The connection between client and server is persistent and relatively
long-lived (i.e., minutes or hours, rather than seconds).</t>
  <t>Either end of the connection may initiate messages to the other</t>
  <t>Messages are delivered in order</t>
</list></t>

</section>
<section anchor="protocol-details" title="Protocol Details">

<t>Session Signaling messages MUST only be carried in protocols and in
environments where a session may be established according to the
definition above.  Standard DNS over TCP <xref target="RFC1035"/><xref target="RFC7766"/>, and DNS over TLS
<xref target="RFC7858"/> are suitable protocols.  DNS over plain UDP is not
appropriate since it fails on the requirement for in-order message
delivery, and, in the presence of NAT gateways and firewalls with short UDP
timeouts, it fails to provide a persistent bi-directional communication
channel unless an excessive amount of keepalive traffic is used.</t>

<t>Session Signaling messages relate only to the specific session in which
they are being carried.  Where a middle box (e.g., a DNS proxy,
forwarder, or session multiplexer) is in the path the middle box
MUST NOT blindly forward the message in either direction.  This does
not preclude the use of these messages in the presence of a NAT box that
rewrites IP-layer or transport-layer headers but otherwise maintains the
effect of a single session.</t>

<t>A client MAY attempt to initiate Session Signaling messages at any time on
a connection; receiving a NOTIMP response in reply indicates that the
server does not implement Session Signaling, and the client SHOULD NOT
issue further Session Signaling messages on that connection.</t>

<t>A server SHOULD NOT initiate Session Signaling messages until a
client-initiated Session Signaling message is received first,
unless in an environment where it is known in advance by other
means that the client supports Session Signaling.
This requirement is to ensure that the clients that do not support
Session Signaling do not receive unsolicited inbound Session Signaling
messages that they would not know how to handle.</t>

<section anchor="lifecycle" title="Session Lifecycle">

<t>A session begins when a client makes a new connection to a server.</t>

<t>The client may perform as many DNS operations as it wishes on the newly
created connection. Operations SHOULD be pipelined (i.e., the client
doesn’t need wait for a reply before sending the next message).
The server MUST act on messages in the order they are received, but
responses to those messages MAY be sent out of order, if appropriate.</t>

<t>When a server implementing this specification receives a new connection
from a client, it MUST begin by internally assigning an initial idle
timeout of 30 seconds to that connection.  At both servers and clients,
the generation or reception of any complete DNS message, including DNS
requests, responses, updates, or Session Signaling messages, resets the
idle timer for that connection <xref target="RFC7766"/>.</t>

<t>If, at any time during the life of the connection,
half the idle-timeout value (i.e., 15 seconds by default) elapses
without any DNS messages being sent or received on a connection,
then the connection is considered stale and the client MUST take action.
When this happens the client MUST either send at least one new message
to reset the idle timer – such as a Session Signaling Idle Timeout message
(see <xref target="idletimeout"/>), or any other valid DNS message – or close the connection.</t>

<t>If, at any time during the life of the connection,
the full idle-timeout value (i.e., 30 seconds by default) elapses
without any DNS messages being sent or received on a connection,
then the connection is considered delinquent and the server SHOULD
forcibly terminate the connection. For sessions over TCP (or over TLS over TCP),
to avoid the burden of having a connection in TIME-WAIT state, instead of
closing the connection gracefully with a TCP FIN the server SHOULD abort
the connection with a TCP RST (or equivalent for other protocols).
(In the BSD Sockets API this is achieved by
setting the SO_LINGER option to zero before closing the socket.)</t>

<t>If the client wishes to keep an idle connection open for longer than
the default duration without having to send traffic every 15 seconds,
then it uses the Session Signaling
Idle Timeout message to request a longer idle timeout (see <xref target="idletimeout"/>).</t>

<t>A client is not required to wait until half of the idle-timeout value
before closing a connection. A client MAY close a connection at any time,
at the client’s discretion, if it has no further need for the connection at that time.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="sharing" title="Connection Sharing">

<t>A client that supports Session Signaling SHOULD NOT make multiple
connections to the same DNS server.</t>

<t>A single server may support DNS Updates <xref target="RFC2136"/> and/or
DNS Push Notifications <xref target="I-D.ietf-dnssd-push"/> for one or more DNS zones.
When a client discovers that the DNS Update server and/or DNS Push Notification
server for several different names (including names that fall within different zones)
is the same target hostname and port, the client SHOULD use a single
shared connection for all relevant operations on those names.
A client SHOULD NOT open multiple connections to the same target host and port
just because the names being updated and/or queried are different or
happen to fall within different zones.
This is to reduce unnecessary connection load on the DNS server.</t>

<t>For the purposes here, the determination of “same server” is made by
comparing the target hostname and port of the DNS server (as indicated in the
“_dns‑update‑tls._tcp.&lt;zone&gt;” SRV record or
“_dns‑push‑tls._tcp.&lt;zone&gt;” SRV record),
not the IP address(es) that the target hostname resolves to.
If two different target hostnames happen to resolve to the same IP
address(es), then the client SHOULD NOT recognize these as the “same server”
for the purposes of using a single shared connection to that server.
If an administrator wishes to use a single server for multiple zones and/or
multiple roles (e.g., both DNS Updates and DNS Push Notifications), and wishes to
have clients use a single shared connection for operations on that server, then
the administrator MUST use the same target hostname in the appropriate SRV records.</t>

<t>However, server implementers and operators should be aware that even when
the same target hostname is correctly used, this connection
sharing may not be possible in all cases. A single client device may be home to
multiple independent client software instances that don’t coordinate with each
other, so a DNS server MUST be prepared to accept multiple connections from
different source ports on the same client IP address. This is undesirable from an
efficiency standpoint, but it may be unavoidable in some situations, so a DNS server
MUST be prepared to accept multiple connections from the same client IP address.</t>

<t>Independent client devices behind the same NAT gateway will also typically appear to
the DNS server to be different source ports on the same client IP address.</t>

<t>Clients and servers SHOULD silently ignore unrecognized messages (both requests
and responses) over the connection. This allows for backwards
compatibility with future enhancements.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="format" title="Message Format">

<t>A Session Signaling message begins with the
first 4 octets of the standard DNS message header <xref target="RFC1035"/>,
with the Opcode field set to the Session Signaling Opcode.
A Session Signaling message does not contain
the QDCOUNT, ANCOUNT, NSCOUNT and ARCOUNT fields
fields used in standard DNS queries and responses.
This 4-octet header is followed by a single Session Signaling operation TLV.
The operation TLV may be followed by one or more modifier TLVs, such as
the Terminate TLV (0), which, in error responses, indicates the time interval
during which the client SHOULD NOT re-attempt a failed operation.
Future specifications may define additional modifier TLVs that may be used in
addition to the operation TLV.
A Session Signaling message MUST contain exactly one operation TLV.</t>

<t>Since Session Signaling messages contain no ARCOUNT field, there is, by
design, no way to add an EDNS(0) option to a Session Signaling message.
If functionality provided by current or future EDNS(0) options is desired
for Session Signaling messages, a Session Signaling operation TLV or
modifier TLV needs to be defined to carry the necessary information.</t>

<t>Similarly there is, by design, no way to add a TSIG record to a Session
Signaling message. If this capability becomes necessary in the future a
Session Signaling modifier TLV needs to be defined to perform this function.</t>

<t>Note however that, while Session Signaling <spanx style="emph">messages</spanx> cannot include
EDNS(0) or TSIG records, a Session Signaling <spanx style="emph">session</spanx> is typically used to carry
a whole series of DNS messages of different kinds, including Session Signaling messages,
and other DNS message types like Query <xref target="RFC1034"/><xref target="RFC1035"/> and Update <xref target="RFC2136"/>,
and those messages can carry EDNS(0) and TSIG records.
This specification explicitly prohibits use of the
EDNS(0) TCP Keepalive Option <xref target="RFC7828"/>
in messages sent on a Session Signaling session (because it duplicates
the functionality provided by the Session Signaling Idle Timeout TLV),
but messages may contain other EDNS(0) options where appropriate.</t>

<t>The MESSAGE ID, QR, Opcode and RCODE fields have their usual meanings <xref target="RFC1035"/>.</t>

<t>In a request message (QR=0) the RCODE MUST be set to zero on transmission,
and silently ignored on reception.</t>

<t>The Z bits are currently unused, and in both requests and responses the
Z bits SHOULD be set to zero (0) on transmission and silently ignored
on reception, unless a future document specifies otherwise.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="message-handling" title="Message Handling">

<t>On a connection between a client and server that support Session Signaling,
once the client has sent at least one Session Signaling message (or it is
known in advance by other means that the client supports Session Signaling)
either end may unilaterally send Session Signaling messages at any time,
and therefore either client or server may be the initiator of a message.
The initiator MUST set the value of the QR bit in the DNS header to zero
(0), and the responder MUST set it to one (1).</t>

<t>Every Session Signaling request message (QR=0) MUST elicit a response (QR=1), which
MUST have the same MESSAGE ID in the DNS message header as in the corresponding request.</t>

<t>An initiator MUST NOT reuse a MESSAGE ID that is already in use for an outstanding
request, unless specified otherwise by the relevant specification for the
Session Signaling TLV in question.
At the very least, this means that a MESSAGE ID MUST NOT be reused for a particular SSOP-TYPE
while the initiator is waiting for a response to a previous request with the same SSOP-TYPE.
For a long-lived operation, such as a DNS Push Notification
subscription <xref target="I-D.ietf-dnssd-push"/> the MESSAGE ID for the operation
MUST NOT be reused for a new subscription as long as the
existing subscription is active.</t>

<t>The namespaces of 16-bit MESSAGE IDs are disjoint in each direction.
For example, it is <spanx style="emph">not</spanx> an error for both client and server to send a request
message with the same ID.
In effect, the 16-bit MESSAGE ID combined with the identity of the initiator
(client or server) serves as a 17-bit unique identifier for a particular operation
on a session.</t>

<t>If a client or server receives a response (QR=1) where the MESSAGE ID does not
match any of its outstanding operations, this is a fatal error and it MUST immediately
terminate the connection with a TCP RST (or equivalent for other protocols).</t>

<t>The RCODE value in a response may be one of the following values:</t>

<t>In a client-initiated Session Signaling Idle Timeout message, the IDLE TIMEOUT
contains the client’s requested value for the idle timeout.
In a server response to a client-initiated message, the IDLE TIMEOUT
contains the server’s chosen value for the idle timeout, which the client
MUST respect. This is modeled after the DHCP protocol, where the client
requests a certain lease lifetime using DHCP option 51 <xref target="RFC2132"/>,
but the server is the ultimate authority
for deciding what lease lifetime is actually granted.</t>

<t>In a server-initiated Session Signaling Idle Timeout message, the IDLE TIMEOUT
unilaterally informs the client of the new idle timeout this point forward
in this connection. In a client response to a server-initiated message,
there is no SSOP-DATA. SSOP-LENGTH is zero.</t>

<t>Note that the lower the IDLE TIMEOUT value, the higher the load on client
and server. For example, an IDLE TIMEOUT value of 200ms would result in a
continuous stream of at least ten messages per second, in both directions,
to keep the connection alive. And, in this example, a single packet loss and
retransmission could introduce a momentary pause in the stream of messages,
long enough to cause the server to overzealously abort the connection.</t>

<t>Because of this concern, the server MUST NOT send a Idle Timeout message
(either a response to a client-initiated request, or a server-initiated message)
with an IDLE TIMEOUT value less than ten seconds.
If a client receives an Idle Timeout message specifying an IDLE TIMEOUT value
less than ten seconds this is an error and the client MUST immediately
terminate the connection with a TCP RST (or equivalent for other protocols).</t>

<t>The Idle Timeout TLV (1) has similar intent to the
EDNS(0) TCP Keepalive Option <xref target="RFC7828"/>.
A client/server pair that supports Session Signaling MUST NOT use the
EDNS(0) TCP KeepAlive option within any message on a connection
once bi-directional Session Signaling support has been confirmed.
Once bi-directional Session Signaling support has been confirmed, if either
client or server receives a DNS message over the session that contains an
EDNS(0) TCP KeepAlive option, this is an error and the receiver of the
EDNS(0) TCP KeepAlive option MUST immediately
terminate the connection with a TCP RST (or equivalent for other protocols).</t>

<t>Upon receiving an error response from the server, a client SHOULD NOT
automatically close the connection. An error relating to one particular operation
on a connection does not necessarily imply that all other operations on that
connection have also failed, or that future operations will fail. The client
should assume that the server will make its own decision about whether or not to
close the connection, based on the server’s determination of whether the error
condition pertains to this particular operation, or would also apply to any
subsequent operations. If the server does not close the connection then the client
SHOULD continue to use that connection for subsequent operations.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="server-initiated-termination" title="Server-Initiated Termination">

<t>If a client makes a connection and then fails to send any DNS messages, then after
a period of inactivity the server SHOULD close the connection. The default idle
timeout in the DNS Session Signaling specification is 30 seconds. A different idle
timeout may be requested by the client, and the server can modify the idle timeout
at any time by responding to a client Idle Timeout request, or by initiating an
Idle Timeout message of its own. If no data has been sent on the connection the
server MAY abort the connection with a TCP RST. If data has been sent on the
connection then the server SHOULD close the connection gracefully with a TCP FIN
so that the data is reliably delivered.</t>

<t>At both servers and clients, the generation or reception of any complete DNS
message resets the keepalive timer for that connection.</t>

<t>In the absence of any other messages on a connection, a client MUST generate
keepalive traffic before the idle timeout expires, or the server is entitled to
close the connection. The client maintains the connection by sending a
Session Signaling Idle Timeout TLV requesting a new timeout value.</t>

<t>If a client disconnects from the network abruptly, without closing its connection,
the server learns of this after failing to receive further traffic from that
client. If no requests, responses, update messages or keepalive traffic occurs on
a connection my the idle timeout, then this indicates that the client is probably
no longer on the network, and the server SHOULD abort the connection with a TCP
RST.</t>

<t>After sending an error response to a client, the server MAY close the connection,
or may allow the connection to remain open. For error conditions
that only affect the single operation in question, the server SHOULD return an
error response to the client and leave the connection open for further operations.
For error conditions that are likely to make all operations unsuccessful in the
immediate future, the server SHOULD return an error response to the client and
then close the connection by sending a Terminate Session TLV, as described below.</t>

<t>There may be rare cases where a server is overloaded and wishes to shed
load. If the server handles this by simply closing connections, the likely
behaviour of clients is to detect this as a network failure, and reconnect.</t>

<t>To avoid this reconnection implosion, the server sends a Terminate
Session TLV (0) to inform the client of the overload situation.
After sending a Terminate Session TLV the server MUST NOT
send any further messages on the connection.</t>

<t>The Terminate Session TLV (0) MUST NOT be initiated by a client.
If a server receives a Terminate Session TLV this is an error and the server MUST
immediately terminate the connection with a TCP RST (or equivalent for other protocols).</t>

<t>Upon receipt of the Terminate Session TLV (0) the client MUST
make note of the reconnect delay for this server, and then immediately
close the connection.
This is to place the burden of TCP’s TIME-WAIT state on the client.
After sending the Terminate Session TLV the server SHOULD allow the
client five seconds to close the connection, and if the client has not
closed the connection after five seconds then the server SHOULD abort
the connection with a TCP RST (or equivalent for other protocols).
(In the BSD Sockets API this is achieved by
setting the SO_LINGER option to zero before closing the socket.)</t>

<t><list style="hanging">
  <t hangText='RECONNECT DELAY:'>
  a time value, specified as a 32 bit word in network order in units of milliseconds,
within which the client MUST NOT establish a new session to the current server.</t>
</list></t>

<t>The RECOMMENDED value is 10 seconds.</t>

<t>In the case of a client request that returns a nonzero RCODE value, the server MAY
append a Terminate TLV (0) to the response, indicating the time interval
during which the client SHOULD NOT attempt this operation again.</t>

<t>When appended to a DNS response message for some client request,
the Terminate TLV (0) is considered a modifier TLV.</t>

<t>When sent in a DNS request message, the Terminate Session TLV (0)
is considered an operation TLV.
The RCODE MUST indicate the reason for the termination.
RCODE NOERROR indicates a routine shutdown.
RCODE SERVFAIL indicates that the server is overloaded due to resource exhaustion.
RCODE REFUSED indicates that the server has been reconfigured and is no longer
accepting DNS Push Notification requests for one or more of the currently
subscribed names.</t>

<t>This document specifies only these three RCODE values for Termination TLVs. Servers
sending Termination TLVs SHOULD use one of these three values. However, future
circumstances may create situations where other RCODE values are appropriate in
Termination TLVs, so clients MUST be prepared to accept Termination Messages with
any RCODE value.</t>

<t>In the case where the server is rejecting some, but not all, of the existing
subscriptions (perhaps because it has been reconfigured and is no longer
authoritative for those names) with a REFUSED (5) RCODE, the RECONNECT DELAY MAY be
zero, indicating that the client SHOULD attempt to re-establish its subscriptions
immediately.</t>

<t>In the case where a server is terminating a large number of connections at once
(e.g., if the system is restarting) and the server doesn’t want to be inundated
with a flood of simultaneous retries, it SHOULD send different THROTTLE delay
values to each client. These adjustments MAY be selected randomly, pseudorandomly,
or deterministically (e.g., incrementing the time value by one tenth of a second
for each successive client, yielding a post-restart reconnection rate of ten
clients per second).</t>

<t>Apart from the cases described above, a server MUST NOT close a connection with a
DNS Push Notification client, except in extraordinary error conditions. Closing
the connection is the client’s responsibility, to be done at the client’s
discretion, when it so chooses. A DNS Push Notification server only closes a DNS
Push Notification connection under exceptional circumstances, such as when the
server application software or underlying operating system is restarting, the
server application terminated unexpectedly (perhaps due to a bug that makes it
crash), or the server is undergoing maintenance procedures. When possible, a DNS
Push Notification server SHOULD send a Terminate Session message informing the
client of the reason for the connection being closed.</t>

<t>After a connection is closed by the server, the client SHOULD try to reconnect, to
that server, or to another server supporting DNS Push Notifications for the zone.
If reconnecting to the same server, the client MUST respect the indicated delay
before attempting to reconnect.</t>

<t>If a server is low on resources it MAY simply terminate a client connection with a
TCP RST. However, the likely behaviour of the client may be simply to reconnect
immediately, putting more burden on the server. Therefore, a server SHOULD instead
choose to shed client load by sending a Terminate Session message, as described above.
Upon reception of the Termination TLV the client is expected to close the
connection, and if it does not then the server will abort the connection five seconds later.</t>
